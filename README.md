# raise26-ai-headlines-analysis
Project submission for RAISE-26, an AI-NLP informatics competition hosted by Rutgers University. Consists of data preprocessing, EDA, and NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF, and sentiment analysis. Interprets results relating to news headlines about AI in education and the workplace. The dataset is confidential and thus not included. The notebook assumes the CSV is placed in a local file.

Datasets will be linked when published by Rutgers.
